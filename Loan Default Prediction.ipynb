    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll get the opportunity to tackle one of the most industry-relevant machine learning problems with a unique dataset that will put your modeling skills to the test. Financial loan services are leveraged by companies across many industries, from big banks to financial institutions to government loans. One of the primary objectives of companies with financial loan services is to decrease payment defaults and ensure that individuals are paying back their loans as expected. In order to do this efficiently and systematically, many companies employ machine learning to predict which individuals are at the highest risk of defaulting on their loans, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will be tackling the loan default prediction problem on a very unique and interesting group of individuals who have taken financial loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are a new data scientist at a major financial institution and you are tasked with building a model that can predict which individuals will default on their loan payments. We have provided a dataset that is a sample of individuals who received loans in 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "This financial institution has a vested interest in understanding the likelihood of each individual to default on their loan payments so that resources can be allocated appropriately to support these borrowers. In this challenge, you will use your machine learning toolkit to do just that!"

    "### Train vs. Test\n",
    "In this competition, you’ll gain access to two datasets that are samples of past borrowers of a financial institution that contain information about the individual and the specific loan. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`train.csv` contains 70% of the overall sample (255,347 borrowers to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether or not the borrower has defaulted on their loan payments (the “ground truth”).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `test.csv` dataset contains the exact same information about the remaining segment of the overall sample (109,435 borrowers to be exact), but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each borrower. It’s your job to predict this outcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the borrowers in `test.csv` will default on their loan payments, or not."

    "Both `train.csv` and `test.csv` contain one row for each unique Loan. For each Loan, a single observation (`LoanID`) is included during which the loan was active. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this identifier column, the `train.csv` dataset also contains the target label for the task, a binary column `Default` which indicates if a borrower has defaulted on payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides that column, both datasets have an identical set of features that can be used to train your model to make predictions. Below you can see descriptions of each feature. Familiarize yourself with them so that you can harness them most effectively for this machine learning task!"
